# NativeAndroidCamera (CameraX flash + video repro)

A tiny Android app generated by JUNIE to reproduce a CameraX bug that occurs when taking a still photo with flash ON while the video use case is also bound.

## What it does
- Fullscreen camera preview (CameraX + Camera2 backend) using Compose.
- A single "Shoot" button at the bottom.
- Captures an image with flash forced ON.
- Binds the VideoCapture use case (not used) to mirror real setups where video is enabled.
- Shows an alert with success/failure after capture; image is not saved.

## Why this app
It’s a minimal, focused repro for issues observed when:
- ImageCapture is set to FLASH_MODE_ON, and
- VideoCapture use case is also bound to the lifecycle.

## Build & Run
1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Sync Gradle and build.
3. Run on a physical device (recommended over emulator).
4. Grant Camera and Microphone permissions when prompted.

## Reproduce steps
1. Launch the app; you’ll see a fullscreen camera preview.
2. Tap “Shoot”.
3. Observe the alert dialog indicating success or failure.
   - Flash is forced to fire during capture.
   - Video use case is bound in the background to surface potential conflicts.

## Notes
- No media files are written to storage; this app is for behavior/bug reproduction only.
- Relevant log tag: "CameraScreen".
- Uses CameraX: Preview, ImageCapture, and VideoCapture.

## Tech stack
- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material3.
- CameraX (camera-core, camera2, lifecycle, view, video).
